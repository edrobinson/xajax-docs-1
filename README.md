Documentation files for the Xajax library

The initial files in the docs folder were generated with a php script that parses the source files, extracts the comment blocks and the method signatures of all public methods and uses the info to generate markdown files from a template specific to the class being parsed. These are very preliminary and open to discussion and modification. All suggestions and changes are welcome. Any assistance in the documentation task is also welcome...
